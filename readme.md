# AoC 22

I had the (possibly dumb) idea of using this year's Advent of Code as an opportunity to teach myself C. I'm hoping at least some of my C# knowledge will translate.

<!-- ## Day 1
- Reading a file line-by-line. This isn't too hard, but not sure if I did it in the most efficient way. 
- I actually got the correct answer before my code was completely working for Part 2. I wasn't doing any sorting when checking the highest value in the array. This meant I wasn't actually replacing the lowest value, just the first value that was lower than the new value. The input data was written such that the sorting happened automatically and my code returned the correct value even though the logic was wrong. I tested with a few changes to the dataset and everything seems to be working correctly now.

## Day 2
- Played with pointers in functions today and have no idea whether I used them correctly. Everything works though.
- I might come back to this one later to try to clean it up a little bit. I don't like how I implemented part 2, but it is what it is for now. 

## Day 3
- Once again not done in the most efficient way, but still learning a lot. 

## Day 4
- This was definitely the hardest input to parse so far, but, once I had access to the data, the logic was fairly straightforward.

## Day 5
- This one kicked my butt. The hardest part was parsing the data. There's probably a way better method, but the sscanf function was super useful for getting the movement directions.
- I ended up using a stack, but there was no way I could implement my own without spending way more time. The implementation I used was a combination of a few articles that are linking in the .c file. 

## Day 6
- This one stumped me for a second, but I got there eventually. More often than not, it's not the problem itself that is tricky, it's how to solve the problem without some feature of modern languages. C is proving to be tricky at times.
- Very proud that all I had to do to solve part 2 was change a variable.

## Day 7
- Learned about recursively reading files in C by setting and getting the file pointer manually. Definitely not easy to wrap my head around, but I got there in the end. -->
